Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for the extra credit for Computer Science 102.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a reflection document on the main "talk-aways" of the talk. Please include the following information in your reflection piece; the talk you attended (the Q & A session or the main talk) and what you learned or found to be interesting during the talk. What else did you observe about the talk? How could this observation change you as a person or a professional in the future?


## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).


## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the practical
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
